# Era of Robots.

There is a time when we all thought that robots will never come to reality or existance. We always watched these in movies, some read them in magazines, guess what now
some robots have replaced human labor in the working industry.
Robotics is a field of study that deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. Robotics has applications in many industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation, and involves a variety of technical areas, such as computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Robotics has the potential to automate tasks that are dangerous, repetitive, or impossible for humans to do, and can increase efficiency and productivity in many areas.
